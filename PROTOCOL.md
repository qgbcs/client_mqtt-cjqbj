# Protocol

## Target selection and setup
The selected target record determines the MQTT `request_topic` and connection options for each RPC. Shared Aliyun configuration is stored once at the root of `client_mqtt.json`. Before submitted feature code runs, the client prepends a short Python setup block which merges this global Aliyun JSON object into `sys._qgb_dict["aliyun_git"]`. This does not add fields to the MQTT request envelope; it initializes the target interpreter for the existing code payload. Do not log the configuration because it may contain credentials.

## RPC envelope metadata
The feature result retains MQTT response metadata under `_rpc`: `req_id`, `server_time`, `server_from`, `client_from`, `latency_ms`, and local `elapsed_ms`/`request_id` when available. The app diagnostics log records the same transport details plus topic, phase, and broker connection states on timeout. It must never include the private key, Aliyun values, or submitted RPC code.

## Browse request
The generated target code receives:

- `root`: configured allowed root on the target device
- `offset`: number of sorted file entries to skip
- `limit`: maximum entries for this page
- `recursive`: currently `true`

The result must be JSON with `ok`, `root`, `items`, `has_more`, and `next_offset`. Each item contains a relative path, kind, size, modified time, and optional error. RPC `r` must be a JSON string so the client never parses Python pretty repr.

## Transfer result
A file transfer RPC returns only short metadata: `ok`, `url`, `name`, `size`, `content_type`, and optional `error`. The JPEG or file bytes never appear in the MQTT response.

## Wi-Fi result
The Wi-Fi feature returns JSON metadata under `wifi`, including `ssid`, `bssid`, `rssi`, `link_speed`, `frequency`, `ip`, and `mac`. The UI renders this JSON; it does not depend on Python repr formatting.

## Photo result
Photo RPC returns the same transfer metadata plus camera facing and capture duration. The target must convert the Java callback buffer to Python `bytes`, upload it directly, and release the camera in `finally` without creating a photo file.

## Errors
RPC responses use structured error fields. The client feature dispatcher returns `ok: false`, `feature`, `action`, and `error` when Python feature code raises, including `SystemExit`; do not forward a traceback, token, private key, or authorization header to the UI. Native/JVM crashes and forced process termination cannot be recovered by the Python exception boundary.

## Hot-updatable features
Feature modules use the names `feature_files`, `feature_camera`, and `feature_wifi`. The stable dispatcher calls `bootstrap.call_feature(feature, action, *args)`. Runtime updates must be `feature_*.py` files written atomically into the app-private `files/py_updates/` directory. Optional SHA-256 verification is supported by `bootstrap.install_feature`; unsigned or path-traversal filenames are rejected.

The UI catalog refresh interval is three seconds. A script is not required to ship an Android class: its `FEATURE.title` is the pager title and its `FEATURE.actions` become generic action buttons. See `FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT.md` for the complete contract.
